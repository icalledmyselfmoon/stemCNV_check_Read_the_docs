**Introduction**
StemCNV-check is a tool written to simplify copy number variation (CNV) analysis of SNP array data, specifically for quality control of (pluripotent) stem cell lines. StemCNV-check uses snakemake to run the complete analysis from raw data (.idat) up report generation for all defined samples with a single command. Samples need to be defined in a (tabular) sample table and the workflow settings are defined through a yaml file.
